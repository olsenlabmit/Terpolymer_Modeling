OD/OD0 plots for individual polymer samples. Samples with an "_RE" refer to polymers resynthesized to higher molecular weight but containing the same monomers as another polymer in the library.
Data for both the lower and higher molecular weight polymers are provided.

Sample details, including biodegradability from these OD plots, are found in the publication Supplementary Dataset.
