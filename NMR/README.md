The H1 Polymer NMR Spectra are sorted into MestReNova documents. The pages of these documents contain the original fid data as well as analysis performed. The name of each page title contains the polymer name.
To find a specific polymer of interest, please note the abbreviations indicating the monomers in the polymer name. The polymer is found in the first document (highest priority) named for one of the monomers.
For example, DGA50_BTD25_GGE25 is found in GGEandBPA because GGE appears in a higher priority document than DGA. However, GLA25_DGA25_PTD50 appears in DGA_EBA based on DGA because GLA is found in a lower priority document (GLA_ADA) than DGA. 
The order for documents (priority order) is:
1. DMT_Polymers
2. DMI_Polymers
3. GGEandBPA
4. DEGandTEG
5. TOA
6. DGA_EBA
7. SCA_CCD
8. GLA_ADA
9. AZA_SUA_SBA
